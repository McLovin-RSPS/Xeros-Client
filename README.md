# Glacyte Client
## Run arguments

## Developer mode
Developer modes give you the ability to have a cache placed inside the client directory at `/client/local_cache/`. 
It also allows you to use developer commands (also enabled if you have the developer rank in-game) and prints out some warnings that otherwise aren't shown.

## How to Move Plugins from One RuneLite RSPS Client Project to Another

If you want to move plugins from one RuneLite RSPS client project to another, you can follow these steps:

1. **Locate the original project's "plugins" folder:** First, navigate to the installation directory of the original RuneLite RSPS client project on your computer. Look for a folder named "plugins" within the project directory. This is where all the plugin files are stored.

2. **Copy the plugin files:** Once you have located the "plugins" folder, select all the plugin files that you want to move to the new project. Right-click on the selection and choose the "Copy" option from the context menu.

3. **Locate the new project's installation directory:** Next, navigate to the installation directory of the new RuneLite RSPS client project on your computer. Look for a folder named after the project's name or RuneLite. This is where you will paste the plugin files.

4. **Create a new "plugins" folder (if needed):** If the new project does not already have a "plugins" folder, you will need to create one. Right-click inside the new project's installation directory, select "New Folder" and name it "plugins".

5. **Paste the plugin files:** Open the newly created "plugins" folder in the new project's installation directory. Right-click inside the folder and select "Paste" from the context menu. This will copy the plugin files from the original project's "plugins" folder into the new project's "plugins" folder.

6. **Copy the configuration files (if applicable):** Some plugins come with configuration files that are needed for the plugin to function correctly. If the plugin you want to move has configuration files, navigate to the original project's directory and locate them. Copy these files over to the new project's "settings" folder, which is located within the project's installation directory.

7. **Start RuneLite:** Start the RuneLite RSPS client for the new project to see if the plugins are actively installed and working correctly. If the plugins are working correctly, you should be able to see them in the client's plugin menu.

8. **Adjust settings:** If the plugin has new settings, you can change them in the new project's configuration panel. To access the configuration panel, open the plugin menu in the RuneLite RSPS client and click on the plugin's name. This will open a new window where you can adjust the plugin's settings.

That's it! Following these steps should allow you to move plugins from one RuneLite RSPS client project to another. If you encounter any issues, make sure to double-check that you have followed each step correctly and that the plugin files are located in the correct folders.
